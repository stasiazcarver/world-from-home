    <span class="intro-text">At World From Home, we believe virtual travel can be just as eye-opening.
      <br><br> We've made it easy for you to dive into the sights, sounds and tastes of different
      countries around the globe, through carefully curated food and culture recommendations. <br> Use our
      <a href="../index.html">interactive map</a> to choose your destination, or browse our <a href="page-4.html">A-Z
        guide</a> of countries to see all our recommendations in one place. And <a href="join.html">join in</a> by
      recommending your favourite films, music and recipes from countries missing from our map!<br><br>

        in
        response to the travel restrictions
        caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, but this isn't just a project for lockdown. The climate crisis demands
        that we fly less, consume less; we want to show that you don't have to go on a mini-break abroad to experience
        other cultures.<br><br>We also want this site to provide a
        cultural resource that will enrich and inspire the trips our readers do make, helping you discover cultural
        aspects of your destination you might not have known about, or even inspiring you to explore places
        you might not have otherwise visited! </span><br><br><span class="subtitle">Happy
        travelling!</span>
